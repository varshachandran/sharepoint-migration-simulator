# SharePoint Migration Simulator - Challenges and Solutions

## Challenge 1: Data Cleaning
- **Issue**: Inconsistent data formats (dates, empty strings vs null)
- **Solution**: Implemented data transformation layer to standardize formats

## Challenge 2: Handling Relationships
- **Issue**: Need to maintain department/position relationships
- **Solution**: Created reference documents and stored Firestore references

## Challenge 3: Performance with Large Datasets
- **Issue**: Potential performance issues with large migrations
- **Solution**: Implemented batch processing with Promise.all()

## Challenge 4: Duplicate Detection
- **Issue**: No unique identifier in source data
- **Solution**: Generated UUIDs for each record and used EmpID as secondary key

## Challenge 5: Data Type Conversion
- **Issue**: CSV imports all data as strings
- **Solution**: Implemented type conversion for numbers, dates, booleans

## Best Practices Implemented
1. Data validation and cleaning before migration
2. Maintaining referential integrity
3. Preserving original data in `rawData` field
4. Adding timestamps for audit purposes
5. Proper error handling and logging
